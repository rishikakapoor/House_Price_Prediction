# House Price Prediction

House Price Prediction is an application that was part of kaggle competition, the dataset was collected from kaggle and I performed Feature Engineering and Advanced Regression Techniques to predict house prices for the Data Contest. 
 
 Application is developed by comparing models and selecteing the best one by comparing MSE score. The models were selected by analyzing the data by performing Exploratory Data Analysis.
 The model with the best results was Gradient Boosting Regressor which outperformed the SVM and Poly regression with PCA. 

This was a great competition and got to learn a lot from this dataset, It was my first time dealing with these many features the data set has 81 features including the target variable and analyzing these features was nit easy but learned to handle. I'm sure now I'm prepared to handle dataset with more than 100 features and visualize them. 

What I learned:
1. Visualize and perform data analysis on a big dataset, especially dataset having 80 feature.
2. How to perform feature engineering on features having 50% Null values.
3. Strategy for featues ffor less than 20% Null values.
4. House Prediction Feature Importance (Over_all_Quality) feature plays the most important role in predicting the price.



The application can be used by investors interested in the housing market which will help them identifies opportunities in the real estate market in real time.
